## Tamaweb Project
A Virtual Pet game project inspired by modern Tamagotchi devices, aiming to bring a pure virtual pet experience to multiple devices.

For now the project is using Tamagotchi sprites, but the plan is to eventually replace every sprite with original designs, for now the focus is on the core gameplay, VISUAL DESIGN IS PLACEHOLDER and everything seen is subject to change.

### Credits
- Thanks a lot to Curlour for inspiration and letting me use their Tamagotchi sprites from Eternitchi for the early stages of development: https://sa311.tumblr.com/post/163140958242/about-me
