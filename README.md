## Tamaweb Project
A Virtual Pet game project inspired by modern Tamagotchi devices, aiming to bring a pure virtual pet experience to multiple devices.

For now the project is using Tamagotchi sprites, but the plan is to eventually replace every sprite with original designs, for now the focus is on the core gameplay, VISUAL DESIGN IS PLACEHOLDER and everything seen is subject to change.

Here's a list of features and to-do list:

## Done:
- Pets with Hunger, Fun, Sleep, Health stats and their individual genetics
- Life stages (baby, teen, adult) and evolutions
- Ability to purchase food and medicine from the mall (each food item has it's own stats such as hunger-satisfaction, healthiness, etc.)
- Friendship system and ability to possibly meet new friends at the park and develop relationship with them by hanging out and inviting them over
- Game Center in the mall and a way to win money by playing games (only one non-interactive game for now so work-in-progress)
- Job system and a way to make money by working
- Your pet will poop eventually and you have to clean them by using the bath option in the menu (if not cleaned, your pet may get sick if exposed to it for an extended amount of time)
- Ability to get Doctor visit to get status on your pet's health
- Offline progression, meaning when you close the game and comeback after some time, all the stats will be calculated as if you had the game open the entire time (although dropping at a much slower speed). note that your pet will be sleeping from 22:00 to 9:00 when offline, so no stats drop during that time.
- Ability to purchase toys and items your pet game play with and use
- Discount days: All shops will sell their products at a discounted rate on the 7th, 12th, 18th, 20th, 25th, 29th and 30th day of each month!
- Ability to marry your friends with high enough relationship level
- Ability to purchase home backgrounds
- Ability to throw birthday parties and invite your pets friends

## To-do:
- Have the babies inherit some of each parents genetics (such as max hunger, sleep and fun and their satisfaction and dissatisfaction and their deplete and replenish rates)
- Ability to get your (and other) pets genetically tested to see the their stats so that when breeding you can aim for specific stat values
- Baby sitter so that your pet can be taken care of when you don't have enough time to care for them
- Ability to purchase furniture and decorate your home
- More Game Center games and activities
- More jobs
- Ability to customize your pet by purchasing clothing and accessories
