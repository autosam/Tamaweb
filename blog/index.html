                        <small>
                        Like the fact the since the <i>care and neglect update</i> 
                        your pet wasn't <i>actually</i> able to die if you left them alone
                        for an extended period of time (the chances of them dying was only triggering if you were in-game all the time and not when offline progressing), so you need to take a better care of them now :)
